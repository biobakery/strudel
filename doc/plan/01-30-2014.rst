Strudel: Plan 01-30-2014
===========================

* To Do 
	+ Make strudel orthogonal from HAllA; there is no reason for strudel to be dependent on HAllA,
	since strudel should be standalone.
	+ Design direction: should include rudimentary "summary mode" in strudel, so that a user can view the nature of data against common baseline functions before trying it out in their own pipeline 
	+ Parametric 
		-Pearson/Spearman cor 
		-ANOVA
		-X2/Fishers
	+ Nonparametric 
		-Pearon/Spearman
		-KW
		X2/Fishers  

* Completed 
	+ Documentation and description added
	+ "Spiking in" done
