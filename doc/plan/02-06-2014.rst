Strudel: Plan 02-04-2014
=========================================

Done
-------------------------------------------

To Do From Previous 
-------------------------------------------
* auc and roc_curve needs to be made general so that it can handle bags of associations 
* Also, fix roc_curve behavior; allow for meta_roc_curve -- if more than one method passed in, let it graph arbitrary number of ROC curves with legends 
** how to handle true positive/ false positive behavior? 
** [[1,2,3],[4,5]] :: if any 
* Big task: refactor code and transfer from halla -> strudel if needed 
* Big task: finish implement test cases for George to initiate discussion. 
* Read 2 Efron papers 
* Glance over the Dantzig selector paper 
* Next priority
** PyMC
** PyMix 
** Wrapping to d3, etc 
** name change? 
** website set-up (strudelpy.org -- try hutlab4?)
** HAllA, CAKE, SparseDOSSA integration 

Notes
-------------------------------------------

* Is there already a general function that handles 
** 1-1 
** 1-many
** many-1 
** many-to-many?
* If not should write. 
** Remember __eval, _eval, and eval handles a lot of these behaviors; refactor if necessary.
