Strudel: Plan 02-10-2014
==========================

Agenda Reminder 
-------------------------------------------

* HAllA
  ** Implementation design, modularity, overall structure, and first tests in IPython look good
  ** Evaluation
  *** Four areas to consider: different types of inputs, different parameter settings, different competitors, different output evaluations
  *** Last is easy - we can focus on simple ROCs for the forseeable future
  *** Competitors to consider as a baseline:
  **** Feature-wise parametric tests:
  ***** Pearson = continuous/continuous
  ***** ANOVA = continuous/categorical
  ***** X2/Fishers = categorical/categorical
  **** Feature-wise nonparametric tests:
  ***** Spearman = continuous/continuous
  ***** K-W = continuous/categorical
  ***** X2/Fishers = categorical/categorical

##Fishers is not done because of contingency table issues; fix later 

  *** Consider different types of inputs (both continuous + categorical):
  **** Uniform random, no cluster structure, linear spikes
  **** Normal random, no cluster structure, linear spikes
  **** Uniform mixture model (clusters), linear spikes
  **** Normal mixture model (clusters), linear spikes
  **** Normal random, no cluster structure, sine spike

Notes 
-------------------------------------------

* Parametric MI code:: 

        df <- (bins1-1)*(bins2-1)
        G = 2*n_samp*mutual_information
        p_value <- 1-pchisq(G,df)

* Paper: MI and G-test for contingency tables 

For George 
-------------------------------------------

* Fix association to be generalizable 
    + reduce_method 
  

To Do From Previous 
-------------------------------------------

* Generic "invariance" function that makes sure everything is of the proper type for quick debugging purposes
* auc and roc_curve needs to be made general so that it can handle bags of associations
* Also, fix roc_curve behavior; allow for meta_roc_curve -- if more than one method passed in, let it graph arbitrary number of ROC curves with legends
** how to handle true positive/ false positive behavior?
** [[1,2,3],[4,5]] :: if any
* Big task: refactor code and transfer from halla -> strudel if needed
* Big task: finish implement test cases for George to initiate discussion.

* Next priority
** PyMC
** PyMix
** Wrapping to d3, etc
** name change?
** HAllA, CAKE, SparseDOSSA integration
