* Idea of the day: have supervised association learning scheme?
	+ Allow users to input known association patterns so that the algorithm can find things that are close to those 
	+ Three modes: unsupervised, supervised, semi-supervised

### To avoid confusion, should always use notion of strength, not distance, for association measures 
### -1,0,1 
### -1 -> give only association value 
### 0 -> give both association value and pvalue 
### 1 -> give only pvalue
